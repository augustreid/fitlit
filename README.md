## Illustrations
  On page load a random user's information will be displayed on the dashboard. The left-hand sidebar contains more detailed information about the current user on display. There is space above the user's information for a profile picture to be added (on a later iteration). Each color block contains information for specific set of tracked data. In the top right corner of the dashboard, the date for the latest user data is displayed.



  When you click the button labeled `Today` a drop down menu will appear, allowing you to choose different date ranges to view a user's data for a `week` or for `all time`.
